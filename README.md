# Mouse-actions-control-by-hand-gesture

# Description

The project "Mouse actions control by hand gesture" is an application that allows users to control their computer mouse using hand gestures, instead of a physical mouse or touchpad. The project utilizes computer vision and machine learning techniques to recognize specific hand gestures and map them to specific mouse actions, such as clicking, scrolling, and dragging.

The system works by capturing live video input from a camera and using image processing algorithms to extract features related to the user's hand, such as its position, orientation, and shape. These features are then fed into a machine learning model, which has been trained on a dataset of hand gestures and their corresponding mouse actions. The model predicts the intended mouse action based on the current hand gesture, and sends the appropriate commands to the computer.
